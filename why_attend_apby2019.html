                            <h1>9 Reasons Why You Need to Go to APBY Conference 2019</h1>
                            <p>May 2019 is getting closer and closer, and we’re all excited to go to the Asia Pacific
                                Baptist Youth Conference
                                happening in Baguio City, Philippines. Maybe you’ve been to an APBY Conference before,
                                or maybe you haven’t. Allow
                                us to give you 9 good reasons why you need to go.</p>
                            <h3>1. For the greater glory of God!</h3>
                            <p>If you are a youth leader or a youth minister/pastor in your church, you understand that
                                it is God’s ministry to
                                your local church, and not yours. Coming to APBYCon 2019 allows you to be filled,
                                equipped, and refreshed to work
                                for God’s glory. Expect to be motivated and pushed towards lifting up the name of Jesus
                                in your ministry!
                            </p>
                            <h3>2. Worship the Lord among the nations!</h3>
                            <p>It’s not every day that you get to experience worshiping with more than a thousand other
                                youth leaders, pastors, and
                                ministers from 23 different nations. This exciting mix of different cultures is sure to
                                make for a wonderful
                                atmosphere of singing and lifting up praises to the Lord!</p>

                                <img src="assets/img/why-2.jpg" alt="">

                            <h3>3. Be strengthened from the Word.</h3>
                            <p>Expect to dig deep into God’s Word, as we hear the call of the King to make disciples
                                among the nations. We will
                                need nothing less than the explosive power of the Gospel to give us strength in our
                                daily ministries, and we’ve
                                asked some wonderful men and women to open up and share God’s Word to us.</p>
                            
                                <img src="assets/img/why-3.jpg" alt="">

                            <h3>4. Listen to stories of how God is moving through the global Church.</h3>
                            <p>Hear stories from other cultures of how the Lord is moving in Baptist churches surviving
                                and thriving in the Asian
                                region. Be moved to stand with and pray with other youth in their challenges,
                                victories, sufferings, and as they
                                place their hope in Christ alone.</p>

                                <img src="assets/img/why-4.jpg" alt="">

                            <h3>5. Strategize for the future.</h3>
                            <p>Be equipped in relevant workshops that are designed to give you tools to work with in
                                your local church context.
                                Enter into a space of learning and equipping, so that you can be encouraged to work
                                better in the ministries
                                entrusted to us.</p>

                                <img src="assets/img/why-5.jpg" alt="">

                            <h3>6. Develop global partnerships.</h3>
                            <p>As you interact with different churches from different nations, allow the Lord to open
                                up opportunities of
                                partnership for the completion of the Great Commission. The local church works in a
                                specific context, but it can
                                also reach out and be a blessing to other churches, cultures, and nations.</p>

                            <h3>7. Make and strengthen bonds of friendship, old and new.</h3>
                            <p>Reconnect with old friends from other countries, and definitely make new friendships as
                                well. Coming together as
                                Baptist youth in Asia allows us to have a certain bond that will give us lifetime
                                friends to share victories with,
                                as well as suffering. Allow Jesus to be the bond between us!</p>

                            <h3>8. Experience the power of praying together.</h3>
                            <p>As you hear and experience stories of life in different countries and cultures, take the
                                opportunity to stand in the
                                gap for churches suffering persecution and ask God to open windows and doors of
                                opportunities to share the Gospel.
                                Pray together with Baptist youth from other nations who have specific needs and
                                challenges.</p>

                                <img src="assets/img/why-8.1.jpg" alt="">

                            <h3>9. Hear from God.</h3>
                            <p>The APBY Conference is a chance to step into a place of hearing what the Lord wants for
                                your life. The Lord is sure
                                to use his Word, his message through speakers and workshops, and even conversations
                                with other Baptist youth to
                                fill you with strength and guidance to do his will. </p>
